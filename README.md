My humble work on [the nand2tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

The assembler, VM translator, and compiler are written in C for the heck of it.

You need a C11 compiler, [gperf](https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/), and [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) for building.

The toolchain mostly does the job though it may be full of bugs (who knows).

## TODO:
* tests
* All other things I'm lazy to type.
