My humble work on [the nand2tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

The assembler, VM translator, and compiler are written in C for the heck of it.

You need a C11 compiler, [gperf](https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/), and [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) for building.

## TODO
* tests
* more optimizations and extensions (see links below)
